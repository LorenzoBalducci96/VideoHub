# VideoHub
A web-based application that allows to share video files on a web server.

It's designed to share a film library over a lan network.

A remote file manager implemented with the usage os servlets let user add new files to the web server without any kind of autentication (it's intended to be used on a private network).

The web page has a video player that can stream the requested video selected from the library.

The administrator (and just the administrator, owning a password) can access to remove files and folders.

Future improvements: everyone can start to stream their own "recorded desktop" and that stream has to be accessible to everyone else in the lan.
